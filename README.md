#### Table creation code

``` sql
  CREATE TABLE Manufacturers (
    Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    Name CHAR(50) NOT NULL 
  );

  CREATE TABLE Products (
    Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    Name CHAR(50) NOT NULL ,
    Price REAL NOT NULL ,
    Manufacturer INTEGER NOT NULL 
      CONSTRAINT fk_Manufacturers_Code REFERENCES Manufacturers(Code)
  );
```

#### Answers

``` sql
  SELECT name FROM products;
  SELECT name, price FROM products;
  SELECT name FROM products WHERE price <= 200;
  SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 60 AND 120;
  SELECT name, price * 100 FROM products;
  SELECT AVG(price) FROM products;
  SELECT AVG(price) FROM products WHERE manufacturer = 2;
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE price >= 180;
  SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE price >= 180 ORDER BY price DESC, name;
  SELECT * FROM products p JOIN manufacturers m ON p.manufacturer = m.code;
  SELECT p.name, price, m.name FROM products p JOIN manufacturers m ON p.manufacturer = m.code;
  SELECT AVG(price), manufacturer FROM products GROUP BY manufacturer;
  SELECT AVG(price), m.name FROM products p JOIN manufacturers m ON p.manufacturer = m.code GROUP BY m.name;
  SELECT AVG(price), m.name FROM products p JOIN manufacturers m ON p.manufacturer = m.code GROUP BY m.name HAVING AVG(price) >= 150;
  SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price) FROM products);
  SELECT m.name, p.name, price FROM products p JOIN manufacturers m ON p.manufacturer = m.code WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products);
  SELECT m.name, AVG(p.price), COUNT(p.manufacturer) FROM products p JOIN manufacturers m ON p.manufacturer = m.code GROUP BY p.manufacturer, m.name, p.price HAVING p.price >= 145 AND count(p.manufacturer) >= 2;

  INSERT INTO products (code, name, price, manufacturer) VALUES ((SELECT count(*) FROM products) + 1, 'Loudspeakers', 70, 2);
  UPDATE products SET name = 'Laser Printer' WHERE code = 8;
  UPDATE products SET price = price - (price * 0.1);
